- **Enhanced Fallback**: Converts bad addresses to serviceable ones: "A11 577, Near Main Market Area, City Center, Complete Address Required"
- **Product Description Cleaning**: Detects garbage data like "66ry77777777" and uses "General Merchandise Items"
- **Phone Number Validation**: Ensures proper 10-digit phone numbers with fallbacks
- **Name Validation**: Handles missing/invalid customer names gracefully

### 2. **✅ Smart HSN Code Generation**
- **70+ Category Mappings**: Comprehensive HSN code database
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Handles variations in category names
- **Auto-generation**: Smart HSN code selection based on product category/description
